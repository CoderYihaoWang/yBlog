# yBlog

The theme [yBlog](https://coderyihaowang.github.io/yblog) is a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme that was made specifically for my [personal blog](https://coderyihaowang.github.io). It is simple, yet has some interesting features. The one that I like the most is the **`Command Pallete`**. To invoke it, press Ctrl + ` (and use Escape to close it). Or, you can simply click on my name on the top-left corner of the screen.

**`Command Pallete`** gives you more control to the blog (hidden power!). Here, you can toggle dark mode, decide whether the top bar should be sticky, switch among tabs, searching key words in all articles (regex supported), and many more. Simply type in `help` to see the full manual.

Because this theme is mainly for my personal use, pull requests will be ignored. But you are welcome to fork and modify it.
